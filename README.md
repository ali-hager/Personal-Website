## Getting Started

This project requires a temporary development server to run and view it locally. Here's how to get started:

1. Setting Up a Temporary Server:

I recommend using a lightweight development server like "Live Server" for a smooth experience. You can install extensions for VS Code or other code editors that provide this functionality.

2. Running the Project:

Once you have a temporary server set up, follow these steps:

- Open your project folder in your code editor.
- Launch your temporary server according to the specific extension or tool you're using.
- Instructions for launching the server typically involve a button or command within the extension or a built-in option in the editor's status bar.
- The server will likely assign a local URL (often starting with http://localhost:) to access this project in your web browser. Look for instructions or notifications from the server extension about the assigned URL.
- Open the provided URL in your web browser. You should now be able to view your project running locally.
